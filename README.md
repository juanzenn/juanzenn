# Hello, and welcome! 👋🏼
My name is Juan, I'm a JavaScript developer that focus on the frontend side of things. I found that one of my passions is teaching others, and helping people out.

I want to make a community where new developers can be themselves and learn without problems. Coding should be a safe space for everyone.

I write about JavaScript topics and how you can become **a better developer**.

## My life style ⛰️
I love mountain biking, and the outdoors. I'm an active person and don't enjoy a lot of planning. I like to go by feeling, but also set up realistic goals in the short and mid term. 

I also love cooking and baking some really good bread. 

Long term, my goal is found a MTB academy and a restaurant. One interest I have is investment in real state, but the future Juan can deal with that.

## Connect with me 
I spent a lot of time on Twitter, writing threads and interacting with others. Follow me there if you want to know what what I been up to.
